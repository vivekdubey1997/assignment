 A-Mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:-

1-Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users and perform malicious actions.
To prevent XSS attacks, it is essential to properly encode user-generated content before displaying it in HTML templates.

2-Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to.

B-Mitigating NoSQL Injection Attacks:-


1- NoSQL injection attacks target NoSQL databases used in web applications.
To prevent NoSQL injection attacks, it is essential to validate and sanitize user input before passing it to
NoSQL database queries.
2-Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3-Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
 

 C-Validating User Input:-

 Server-side development must always involve strict user input validation to prevent potential issues, such as SQLi and XSS.
  One way to achieve this is by using the “Ajv” validator, which is a fast JSON Schema validator for Node.js.

  D-Controlling User Access with JWT:-
  JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are widely used to transfer authentication data in client-server applications.
  When using JWT, it is essential to control user access based on specific permissions or roles.



  E-Ensuring Secure Connections and Data Communication Transfer:-

  Securing your application’s connections and data communication transfer is essential. 
  To achieve this, you can rely on Helmet.js from the Node.js modules, which provides 13 middleware functions to set necessary HTTP response headers.



conclusion:-
Ensure a secure web application with Node.js and Express by using the latest version,
validating user input, controlling user access with JWT, and ensuring secure connections and data communication transfer.
